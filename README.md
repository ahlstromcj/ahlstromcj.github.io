## Introduction

I am just getting started with GitHub.io, so do not expect much yet.
This will be a place for discussions and for storing manuals for easy
web access:

    *   __Seq66__:
        A MIDI sequencer/live-looper with a hardware-sampler-like interface.
    *   __Yoshimi-Doc__:
        An advanced user's manual for the Yoshimi software synth.
    *   __Yoshimi-Cookbook__:
        A short and incomplete cookbook for Yoshimi.
    *   __Seq24__:
        The MIDI sequencer/live-looper that inspired **Seq66**.

Now replaced by HTML documentation.

## Goals

    *   Discussion
    *   User manuals
    *   Q&A
