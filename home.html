      out somewhat like the following.

                      **************************************

      The label at the bottom right is a non-clickable label that should
      match the name of the slide in the left-tree view's index.

      Feel free to adapt it, though.  The easiest way is to copy the Home
      slide or some other slide that looks close to what you want for the
      page, and modify it.

      You can also turn the border on if you want to, or change the width of
      the empty cells.

                  I am just getting started with GitHub.io, so do not expect
                  much yet.  This will be a place for discussions and for
                  storing manuals for easy web access, I hope.

                  This projects on this site use the following
                  technologies:
               </p>
               <ul>
                  <li>
                     <b>C.</b>
                     The <i>waonc</i>, <i>midicvt</i>, and the <i>"Seq"</i> projects
                     use the <i>C</i> language to various degrees.  This fact arises
                     from them being derived from legacy code.
                     The <i>xpccutxx</i>
                     was written first in <i>C</i> as an exercise in creating a
                     unit-test framework in a basic language.
                     There are many things that can be done with simple functional code.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>C++.</b>
                     The coding projects at this site use <i>C++</i> heavily.
                     It's our favorite language for it's ability to override operators,
                     provide templates, a raft of standard algorithms, and extreme flexibility.
                     Some balk at its sometimes verbose notation compared to <i>Java</i>,
                     <i>Python</i>, etc., but it seems that every language eventually
                     incorporates <i>C++</i> constructs.  (The reverse is true as well,
                     with lambdas and closures.)
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>GNU Autotools.</b>
                     We got started with this long ago and simply find it usually easy
                     to figure things out, even so far as creating <i>M4</i> platform
                     test macros.
                     At some point we will experiment with <i>cmake</i>
                     (<code>CMakeList.txt</code>!???) and <i>meson</i>
                     In years of exploring other build systems, they all seem to
                     try to replicate the stuff that <i>autotools</i> does, and
                     end up being just as much a Frankenstein monster of
                     sub-technologies.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>ALSA.</b>
                     We got most of our <i>ALSA</i> experience by studying <i>Seq24</i>
                     code.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>JACK.</b>
                     We got most of our <i>JACK</i> experience by studying the 
                     <i>RtMIDI</i> code, but have since gone beyond that in our
                     vaguely-related fork.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Windows MM</b>.
                     Our radical fork of <i>PortMIDI</i> owes its genesis to <i>Seq24</i>,
                     but luckily we had some prior experience with
                     this API from work done a couple decades ago.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>LaTex.</b>
                     Doing documentation in this markup language is powerful, expressive,
                     flexible, and arcane.  It is well supported and nearly bug-free.
                     People write books with <i>TeX</i>/<i>LaTeX</i>.  
                     They have with <i>Microsoft Word</i> as well, but at a cost of
                     a lot of labor and using a crummy editor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>Free42 skinning</b>
                     It was quite fun to make skins for Thomas Okken's <i>Free42</i>
                     calculator emulation, in the <i>free42-resources</i> project.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                     <b>HTML/CSS/Javascript</b>.
                     Our initial experience in static HTML was obtained
                     creating the eary web site of the <i>Charleston Battery</i>
                     soccer team.
                     Later work add CSS and Javascript to the mix.
                     Work-work add ASPX experience which no way we use here.
